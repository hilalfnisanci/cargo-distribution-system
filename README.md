<h2 align="center">Cargo Distribution System</h2>

<h5>This project was made for the programming laboratory course. In this project, I made a desktop application that provides a cargo delivery system. There are two different GUI screens in the desktop application. On the first screen, cargo information is available. The second screen has a map screen.</h5>

<h5> - Cloud connection in the program with Firebase is provided. The Firebase Realtime Database was used to store the data. </h5>
<h5> - The Google Map API was used for the map plugin.</h5>
<h5> - The Traveling Salesman Algorithm was used to show the shortest route on the map. The Branch and Bound solution
using the algorithm is created.</h5>
